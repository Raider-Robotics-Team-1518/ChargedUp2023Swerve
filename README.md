## Other teams
[@Rob-Heslin](https://github.com/Rob-Heslin) - Wrote the Swerve drive code used in this project. Used blackmagic to help us fix
code problems that would not seem to go away. Thank you Rob and Greater Rochester Robotics (340)!

[@mjansen4857](https://github.com/mjansen4857) - Wrote PathPlanner which we use in our 2023 autonomous. This program truly lives up to the
"simple yet powerful" description. Thank you Michael and Ranger Robotics (3015)!

## Mentors
Mr. Schlegel, Mr. Herrmann, Mr. Poulsen, Mr. Szlucha, Mr. Barnes - Huge contributors to the development of this project even if it was or wasn't writing
code; keeping me (Chloe) sane helped a ton. 2 or more minds are always better than one when problem solving, thank you guys!
Mr. D - Always there when my brain was stuck with simple stuff, thank you!
Mrs. D - Always there to keep the team running even when the factors might not be in our favor, Team 1518 appreciates it!
Al - Always there to help bring things back to terms that actually make sense, Team 1518 hopes to continue to see you in the future!
