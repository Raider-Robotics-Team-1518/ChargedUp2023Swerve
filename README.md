### Why are you writing a ReadMe? It's just Robot Code!
This project specifically is special to Team 1518 as it is the first project where we are using advanced control (<b>Swerve</b>) as well as the first project where we are using a Command-Based structure. This is important as it is a big stepping stone in the progression of a good understanding of advanced-control for future Raider Robotics Team 1518 FRC Java projects. 

Not only is this project a huge milestone for Raider Robotics Team 1518, but the ReadMe was also made to properly say thank you to all the people involved in the progression of Team 1518 and this project for Charged Up 2023. 

## Thanks

### Other Teams
[@Rob-Heslin](https://github.com/Rob-Heslin) - Wrote the Swerve drive code used in this project. Used blackmagic to help us fix
code problems that would not seem to go away. Thank you Rob and Greater Rochester Robotics! (Team <b>340</b>)

[@mjansen4857](https://github.com/mjansen4857) - Wrote PathPlanner which we use in our 2023 autonomous. This program truly lives up to the
"simple yet powerful" description. Thank you Michael and Ranger Robotics! (Team <b>3015</b>)

### Mentors
<b>Mr. Schlegel, Mr. Herrmann, Mr. Poulsen, Mr. Szlucha, Mr. Barnes</b> - Huge contributors to the development of this project even if it was or wasn't writing
code; helping keep me (Chloe) sane helped a ton. 2 or more minds are always better than one when problem solving, thank you guys!<br>
<b>Mr. D</b> - Always there when my brain was stuck on the simple parts of complex stuff, thank you!<br>
<b>Mrs. D</b> - Always there to keep the team running even when the factors might not be in our favor, Team 1518 appreciates your work!<br>

### Honorable Mentions
<b>AndyMark, CrossTheRoadElectronics, RevRobotics, and all the other FRC-related companies</b> - FRC wouldn't be what it is today without the work
these companies put in.<br>
