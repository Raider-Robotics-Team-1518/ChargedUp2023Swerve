<h4>Team 1518's Robot Code for First Robotics Competition's 2023 Charged Up</h4>

# Credits
[@Rob-Heslin](https://github.com/Rob-Heslin) - Wrote the Swerve drive code used in this project. Was a huge help in using blackmagic to help us fix
errors that would not seem to go away. Thank you Rob and Greater Rochester Robotics (340)!

[@mjansen4857](https://github.com/mjansen4857) - Wrote PathPlanner which we use in our 2023 autonomous. This program truly lives up to the
"simple yet powerful" description. Thank you Michael and Ranger Robotics (3015)!

Mr. Schlegel, Mr. Herrmann, Mr. Poulsen, and Mr. Szlucha - Huge contributors to the development of this project even if it was or wasn't writing
code; keeping me (Chloe) sane helped a ton. 2 or more minds are always better than one when problem solving, thank you guys!
